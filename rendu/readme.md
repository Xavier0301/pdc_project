# Project of COM-302 Principles of digital communication

## About

This is the implementation of Majdouline Ait Yahia, Xavier Servot and Jonas Konrad for the course project.

## How to use

Our code is contained in the `script.py` python script. To use it you need to run it from the command line with the following arguments:

- `--input_file [filename.txt]` the file containing the string to transmit
- `--python [command]` name of the command to call python from command line on your machine. Is python3 by default.

You need to be connected to the EPFL network for this to work (can be throught the VPN).

`client.py` and `channel_helper.py` is code provided to use which we use to contact the channel server.
