# Project of COM-302 Principles of digital communication

## About

This is the implementation of Majdouline Ait Yahia, Xavier Servot and Jonas Konrad for the course project.
We use an orthogonal codebook generated by the method from exercise 2 from the graded homework 2 with a parameter of 10. This yields codewords of a large enough dimension as to not be bothered by the noise or by the dropping of everything third bit in the channel. We can do this whilst still being below a block size of n = 60000 by dropping the first bit of every utf-8 encoded char. This works because we only need to be able to cope with 1 byte encoded chars which all start by the bit 0 as per the utf-8 standard.

## How to use

Our code is contained in the `script.py` python script. To use it you need to run it from the command line with the following arguments:

- `--input_file [filename.txt]` the file containing the human-readable string to transmit
- `--python [command]` name of the command to call python from command line on your machine. Is python3 by default.

You need to be connected to the EPFL network for this to work (can be throught the VPN).

`client.py` and `channel_helper.py` is code provided to use which we use to contact the channel server.
